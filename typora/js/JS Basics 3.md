Strings are indexed, each character has a corresponding index (a positional number).

String Methods

Methods are built-in actions we can perform.

Some methods accept arguments that modify their behavior. Think of them as inputs that we can pass in. We pass these arguments inside of the parentheses.

`thing.method(arg)`

String Template Literals

Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, which will be evaluated and then turned into a resulting string

'I counted ${3 + 4} sheep; // "I counted 7 sheep"'

You have to use the back-ticks not single quotes (```````);
