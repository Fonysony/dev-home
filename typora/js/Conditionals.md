If Statements - Only Runs code if given condition is true

let rating = 3;

```js
if (rating === 3) {

​	console.log("RATING IS EQUALS 3!!!!!");

}
```

Else if - If not the first thing, maybe this other thing??

```js
let rating = 2;

if (rating === 3) {

​	console.log("YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!");

} else if (rating === 2) {

​	console.log("MEETS EXPECTATIONS");

}
```

Else - If nothing else was true, do this....

```javascript
const age = 20;

if (age <= 5) {

​    toDisplay('Well You are quite young, you enter in for free');

} else if (age < 10) {

​    toDisplay('You are young, you get in for $10');

} else if (age < 65) {

​    toDisplay('You are quite the old one, you get in for $20');

} else {

​    toDisplay('65 wow, you are really old, you get in for $10');

}
```
